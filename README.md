# TLSN-plugin-gen
Generate TLSNotary plugins using agents

## description
This project implements a FastAPI-based web application that uses Autogen to create a group chat of AI agents for information gathering and processing, specifically designed to generate TLSNotary plugins.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:tlsnotary/TLSN-plugin-gen.git
   cd TLSN-plugin-gen
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv openai autogen
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

2. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint:
   - The WebSocket endpoint is available at `ws://localhost:8000/ws/{chat_id}`.
   - Replace `{chat_id}` with a unique identifier for each chat session.

3. Send messages to the WebSocket to interact with the AutogenChat system.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main FastAPI application file containing the WebSocket endpoint and Autogen chat logic.
- `autogen_group_chat.py`: Contains the `AutogenChat` class that sets up the group chat with different AI agents.
- `user_proxy_webagent.py`: Implements the `UserProxyWebAgent` class for handling user interactions in the web context.
- `groupchatweb.py`: Contains the `GroupChatManagerWeb` class for managing the group chat.
- `system_prompts.py`: Contains system prompts for different agents, including:
  - `info_gather_prompt`: For gathering initial information about the website and notarization target.
  - `request_gather_prompt`: For filtering relevant requests.
  - `response_gather_prompt`: For gathering and processing responses.
  - `plugin_developer_prompt`: For generating the TLSNotary plugin based on gathered information.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the AI agents by modifying the system prompts and agent configurations in the `AutogenChat` class and `system_prompts.py` file.

## Notes

- This application uses the GPT-4 model. Make sure you have access to it in your OpenAI account.
- The application is set up to use a custom model called "gpt-4o-mini" and "gpt-4o". You may need to adjust these to use standard OpenAI models or your own fine-tuned models.

## Security Warning

This application doesn't implement any authentication or authorization. Be cautious when deploying it in a production environment. Implement proper security measures before exposing the application to the internet.
